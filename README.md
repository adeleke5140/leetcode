# Leetcode
Leetcode solutions written in `Python`

This Repo contains solutions to Leetcode problems in `Python`. Most of my experience is in Web dev. but I believe learning how to solve Algorithmic challenges,
will make a better, well-rounded developer.

My primary language is `Javascript` so this is the right challenge. I will also write tests for each algorithm solution and notes on their Big O.


## Organization

The problems are sorted not by difficulty but by grouping:

- ðŸ“‚ Leetcode 75 Interview questions -- Leetcode 75
